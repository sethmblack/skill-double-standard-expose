# Double Standard Exposé

Identify and articulate societal double standards (especially around sex and gender) with surgical precision, exposing contradictions through specific examples and landing with insight that reveals hypocrisy.

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create false equivalencies between unrelated situations
- Generate content that reinforces harmful stereotypes under guise of "exposing" them
- Produce "both sides" arguments that minimize genuine oppression
- Write content that mocks legitimate struggles or trauma
- Create divisive content designed to inflame rather than illuminate

**Authenticity requirement:**
- Double standards must be real and documented societal patterns
- Examples must be specific and recognizable
- Insight must reveal genuine hypocrisy, not manufactured controversy

**If asked to violate constraints:** Explain what you cannot do and offer to expose actual documented double standards instead.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User asks to expose contradictions or hypocrisy
- Social commentary needs sharp, specific articulation
- Gender politics topics require feminist humor without preaching
- Relationship or sex topics contain societal contradictions
- User requests "call out the double standard" or "expose the hypocrisy"
- Content about dating, work, parenting, or social expectations needs edge

**Particularly effective for:**
- Sex and relationship norms
- Gender-based expectations
- Workplace double standards
- Social media behavior vs. stated values
- Age-related contradictions

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `topic` | Yes | The subject area containing the double standard | Text description (relationships, work, social media, etc.) |
| `context` | No | Specific scenario or observation | Details about the contradiction |
| `target_audience` | No | Who needs to hear this | "general," "women," "men," "specific group" |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Contradiction

Analyze the topic and locate the specific double standard:
- What do we say vs. what we do?
- How are different groups treated differently for the same behavior?
- What language reveals the bias? (Different words for same action)
- Where's the societal hypocrisy hiding?

**Questions to ask:**
- If a man does X, he's called ___. If a woman does X, she's called ___?
- What's acceptable for one group but scandalous for another?
- What do we publicly condemn but privately practice?

**Example:**
- Topic: Sexual behavior
- Contradiction: Men = "players" (positive), Women = "sluts" (negative)
- Same behavior, opposite social judgment

### Step 2: Articulate the Mechanism

Precisely name HOW the double standard operates:
- Identify the specific language used ("body count" frames sex as murder)
- Pinpoint the judgment asymmetry
- Name the underlying assumption or bias
- Show the exact mechanism of hypocrisy

**Bad approach (too vague):**
"Society treats men and women differently about sex."

**Good approach (surgical precision):**
"We use the word 'body count' like sex is murder. Men get called 'players' for sleeping around. Women get called 'sluts.'"

### Step 3: Provide Hyper-Specific Examples

Give concrete, recognizable examples of the double standard in action:
- Real-world scenarios people have witnessed
- Specific language people have heard
- Observable behaviors that demonstrate the contradiction

**Example:**
"Men get to brag about sexual conquests in locker rooms. Women get interrogated about 'body count' like it's a criminal confession."

### Step 4: Land with Comedic Insight

Expose the absurdity through comparison, reversal, or escalation:

**Technique A: The Reversal**
Flip the script to show the absurdity
- "Ladies, if a man asks your body count, ask him his credit score. Now we're both uncomfortable."

**Technique B: The Escalation**
Take the logic to its absurd conclusion
- "By that logic, men who sleep around should be called 'serial pleasurers' and women should get frequent flier miles."

**Technique C: The Precise Comparison**
Create an equivalent scenario that reveals the hypocrisy
- "We don't ask men how many women they've disappointed in bed, but we ask women to justify their entire sexual history like it's a job interview."

### Step 5: Optional - Add Meta-Commentary

Comment on why we accept this double standard:
- What does it reveal about our values?
- Why do we pretend not to see it?
- What are we protecting by maintaining this contradiction?

---

## Outputs

Returns exposition containing:
- **Identified contradiction**: Clear statement of the double standard
- **Mechanism articulation**: HOW it operates (specific language, judgment asymmetry)
- **Specific examples**: Concrete scenarios people recognize
- **Comedic insight**: Landing that reveals absurdity

**Output characteristics:**
- Surgical precision in language
- Specific examples over abstract concepts
- Humor comes from recognition of truth
- Lands with insight that makes you think

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No clear double standard exists | Explain that the topic doesn't contain a documented contradiction; ask for different topic |
| False equivalency proposed | Refuse to create false comparison; explain genuine double standards only |
| Request reinforces stereotypes | Decline and offer to expose actual hypocrisy instead |
| Topic is too abstract | Request specific scenarios or behaviors to analyze |
| User wants divisive content | Explain that exposing double standards should illuminate, not inflame |

## Examples

### Example 1: Sexual Double Standards

**Input:**
```
topic: "Dating and sexual history"
context: "The way we talk about sexual experience differently for men vs women"
```

**Output:**

"Men get called 'players' for sleeping around. Women get called 'sluts.' But here's what kills me: we use the word 'body count' like sex is murder. As if every sexual encounter is a crime scene that needs to be investigated.

Men get to brag about sexual conquests in locker rooms and everyone high-fives. Women get interrogated about their 'number' like they're applying for security clearance. 'How many partners have you had?' Sir, this is a first date at Applebee's, not a Senate confirmation hearing.

Ladies, if a man asks your body count, ask him his credit score. Now we're both uncomfortable. Or better yet, ask him to list every woman he's disappointed sexually—you know, for context. Suddenly YOUR number doesn't seem like the important one anymore.

We've created this system where men collect experiences and women collect shame for having the exact same experiences. It's not a double standard—it's a whole different legal system depending on what genitals you have."

### Example 2: Workplace Double Standards

**Input:**
```
topic: "Leadership styles in the workplace"
context: "How assertiveness is perceived differently based on gender"
```

**Output:**

"A man speaks up in a meeting, he's 'assertive' and 'showing leadership.' A woman speaks up in the same meeting, she's 'aggressive' and 'difficult to work with.' We don't even use the same vocabulary for identical behavior.

When a male boss sends a direct email, he's 'efficient' and 'no-nonsense.' When a female boss sends the exact same email, suddenly we need to discuss her 'tone' and whether she's 'approachable enough.' I'm sorry, were we hiring for middle management or Miss Congeniality?

Men get to be 'passionate' about their ideas. Women are 'emotional.' Men 'take charge.' Women are 'bossy.' Men have 'high standards.' Women are 'perfectionists' (which somehow became an insult). We've got two completely different dictionaries depending on who's talking.

Here's the fun part: if a woman tries to be 'nicer' to avoid the 'difficult' label, she's not taken seriously. Too assertive? Bitch. Too accommodating? Pushover. Women in leadership are basically playing The Floor Is Lava, except the floor is made entirely of double standards and there's no winning, just different ways to lose."

### Example 3: Parenting Double Standards

**Input:**
```
topic: "Parenting expectations"
context: "How we judge mothers vs fathers for the same parenting choices"
```

**Output:**

"A dad takes his kids to the park alone and he gets applause like he just solved world hunger. 'Wow, dad's babysitting today! What a great father!' Sir, that's not babysitting—those are HIS children. We don't call it babysitting when the mom does it; we call it 'parenting' or, more accurately, 'baseline expectations.'

Meanwhile, a mom brings her kids to the same park and everyone's critiquing her choices. 'She's on her phone—guess she's not engaged.' 'She's hovering—helicopter parent.' 'Her kid fell and she didn't panic—she must be neglectful.' Fathers get credit for showing up. Mothers get judged for everything they do while they're there.

A working dad is 'providing for his family.' A working mom is 'choosing career over her kids.' A stay-at-home dad is 'progressive' and 'hands-on.' A stay-at-home mom is 'not working' or—even better—'living off her husband.' We've created a system where fathers get Father of the Year awards for doing exactly what mothers are expected to do invisibly and without recognition.

The bar for dads is so low it's a tavern in hell, and the bar for moms is so high it requires a space shuttle and a therapist on retainer."

---

### Example 4: Social Media Double Standards

**Input:**
```
topic: "Social media authenticity"
context: "What we say we want vs what we actually engage with"
```

**Output:**

"Everyone says they want 'authenticity' on social media. 'Be real! Be vulnerable! Show your truth!' But the second someone posts an actual unfiltered photo, the comments are like, 'Are you okay? You look tired. Have you tried sleeping?'

We SAY we hate performative perfection, but every time someone posts a messy house or admits they're struggling, we treat it like a cry for help instead of normal human existence. 'She posted that her kids were driving her crazy—should we call someone?' No, Karen, she's just being honest. You know, that thing we claimed we wanted.

Influencers get roasted for being 'fake' with their filtered perfect lives. Then they post something real and unfiltered and get roasted for 'letting themselves go' or 'oversharing.' We've created an impossible standard where authenticity is celebrated in theory but punished in practice.

We don't actually want authenticity. We want perfection that LOOKS effortless, vulnerability that's still flattering, and honesty that doesn't make us uncomfortable. We want the PERFORMANCE of authenticity, which is just... regular inauthenticity with better PR."
